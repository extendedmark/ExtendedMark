# ExtendedMark
Give more power to Markdown

I love Markdown and its simplicity but its features are limited and have some issues on its format. This is a repository to put some ideas to extend markdown file format and fix its issues.

## Markdown Issues

- No target="_blank"
- Indented code block
- HTML block
  - When a blank line is inserted in between, some parsers consider it as a code block

## Additonal Features

- Variables
- Include other markdown file

## Extendability

e.g.

```
# Test

---[component name]
title: Test
content: Content
---
```
