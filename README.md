# ExtendedMark
Give more power to Markdown

I love Markdown and its simplicity but its features are limited and have some issues on its format. This is a repository to put some ideas to extend markdown file format and fix its issues.

## Markdown Issues

- Indented code block
- HTML block

## Additonal Features

- Variables
- Include other markdown file
- Extendability
